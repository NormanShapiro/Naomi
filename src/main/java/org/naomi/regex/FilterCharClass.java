/**
     An instance of FilterCharClass is a {@link Pattern} which, on each
     repetition, matches any single character that lies inclusively (in the
     normal collating sequence) between {@link #getFirst()} and {@link
     #getLast()} and satisfies {@link #filter filter(Char)}.
     If the resulting set (which is <i>not</i> a {@link java.util.Set
     java.util.Set}) contains more than a few thousand characters, performance
     may be adversely impacted. The internal "Not" flag in each instance can be
     set to make the class instead match all characters <i>except</i> those in
     the pre-defined set denoted by {@link #getFirst()}, {@link #getLast()}
     and {@link #filter filter(Char)}; this has the effect of matching the
     complement of the specified set of characters.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
{@code
  // Since FilterCharClass is abstract, its body is
  //	provided here to define the required methods

     // Select ASCII characters between 'A' and 'z'
     // whose two least significant bits are both 1

    FilterCharClass bits = new FilterCharClass()
      {
        public char getFirst() {return 'A';}
        public boolean filter(char ch){return (ch&3) ==3;}
        public char getLast() {return 'z';}

        public FilterCharClass copy()
        {return this;}
      };
}
</pre>
