     An instance of IntervalCharClass is a {@link Pattern} which, on each
     repetition, matches any single character that lies inclusively (in the
     normal collating sequence) between two specified characters. The internal
     "Not" flag in each instance can be set to make the class instead match
     all characters <i>except</i> those in the pre-defined set defined by the
     instantiating character interval; this has the effect of matching the
     complement of the specified set of characters.
