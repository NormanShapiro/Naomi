/**

     An instance of BuiltInCharClass is a {@link Pattern} which, on each
     repetition, matches any single character in the pre-defined set of
     characters denoted by its instantiating BuiltIn Enum constant. The internal
     "Not" flag in each instance can be set to make the class instead match
     all characters <i>except</i> those in the pre-defined set denoted by its
     instantiating BuiltIn Enum constant; this has the effect of matching the
     complement of the specified set of characters.

<p>

A BuiltInCharClass can be instantiated with a constant from any of the enums:
<pre>
    {@link CoreBuiltIn}
    {@link LocaleBuiltIn}
    {@link UniBlockBuiltIn}
    {@link UniScriptBuiltIn}
</pre>
